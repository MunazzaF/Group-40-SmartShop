## Description

Going to the supermarket is an essential part of people's lives, whether to buy groceries or household items. Unfortunately due to the pandemic many people cannot afford to make a trip down to the supermarket. Having an online application, SmartShop, will bring ease and convenience to many customers. With the option to order all products online and pick up in store or get delivered straight to you an online supermarket during this pandemic will be a great success. 

**SmartShop aims to bring the supermarket to your doorstep without you having to leave your doorstep.**
